# Coding Projects

### Online Loan Form

A simple loan application form that utilizes bootstrap and jquery to stylize and perform page-switching, field-validation, and modal operations dependent on the inputs provided.

Relevance: Front-End Development, Web Design

`HTML` `CSS` `Bootstrap` `jQuery`

### Engineering Donor Recognition Display

Work project. Given an Excel spreadsheet of donor names, a way to easily process, style, and display the names in a scrolling list needed to be engineered. The process included writing a macro for Excel to output the spreadsheet into an XML format to be uploaded to the engineering website. From there, the display page takes the spreadsheet-XML data and parses it into HTML using a language native to the CASCADE CMS, Velocity Script. The page is republished periodically, ensuring that the content is up-to-date.
